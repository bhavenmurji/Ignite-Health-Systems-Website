### üîß Key Configuration Files

1. **`vercel.json`** - Deployment configuration
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "cd ignite-health-systems && npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "ignite-health-systems/.next",
     "framework": "nextjs",
     "installCommand": "cd ignite-health-systems && npm install"
   }
   ```

2. **`ignite-health-systems/next.config.ts`** - Next.js optimization
   - Image optimization with WebP/AVIF
   - Security headers configuration
   - Bundle optimization and code splitting
   - Performance monitoring disabled for faster builds

3. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - CI/CD automation
   - Automated testing before deployment
   - Preview deployments for PRs
   - Production deployments on main branch push
   - Lighthouse performance auditing

### üîç Monitoring & Health Checks

The deployment pipeline includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **Real-time Status**: Health checks every 30 seconds
- **Performance Tracking**: Response time, TTFB, content size
- **SSL Monitoring**: Certificate expiration tracking
- **Critical Pages**: All main pages monitored for availability
- **Error Detection**: Automatic issue identification and reporting

### üö® Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
./scripts/deployment-status.sh

# Monitor in real-time
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh

# Force cache refresh
./scripts/cache-invalidate.sh https://your-domain.vercel.app

# Redeploy with logs
./scripts/deploy.sh production open
```

### üîÑ Automatic Cache Invalidation
