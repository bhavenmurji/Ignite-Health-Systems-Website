## Implementation Details

### 1. Mobile Menu & Z-Index Conflicts ✅

**Problem:** Mobile menu overlapping with other elements, z-index conflicts
**Solution:** 
- Implemented strict z-index hierarchy using CSS custom properties
- Mobile menu: `z-index: 1001`
- Navbar: `z-index: 1000` 
- Intro overlay: `z-index: 9999`
- Added backdrop overlay with proper stacking

### 2. Content Overflow on Small Screens ✅

**Problem:** Content exceeding viewport width, horizontal scrolling
**Solution:**
- Applied `overflow-x: hidden` to body and containers
- Implemented fluid containers with `max-width: 100%`
- Added responsive padding and margins
- Content-aware text sizing with `clamp()` functions

### 3. Responsive Breakpoint Optimization ✅

**Problem:** Poor layout adaptation across device sizes
**Solution:**
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Key breakpoints: 375px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Fluid typography and spacing systems
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness

### 4. Touch-Friendly Button Sizing ✅

**Problem:** Small touch targets difficult to use on mobile
**Solution:**
- Minimum 48px touch targets (WCAG compliant)
- Increased tap area without visual changes
- Enhanced button spacing and padding
- Touch action optimization for better responsiveness

### 5. Performance Optimization for Mobile ✅

**Problem:** Poor performance on mobile devices and slow networks
**Solution:**
- Hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- CSS containment for layout optimization
- Network-aware loading for slow connections
- Device capability detection and adaptive features
- Core Web Vitals monitoring and optimization
