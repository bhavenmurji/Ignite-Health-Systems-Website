# Mailchimp Automation Setup for Interest Form Handler

## Overview
Instead of using Gmail, we'll leverage Mailchimp's built-in automation features to send customized welcome emails based on user type.

## Step 1: Update n8n Workflow to Add Tags

In your n8n Interest Form Handler workflow, update the "Add Physician to Mailchimp" node to include tags and merge fields:

### Mailchimp Node Configuration
```javascript
{
  "name": "Add to Mailchimp with Tags",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.mailchimp",
  "parameters": {
    "authentication": "oAuth2",
    "resource": "member",
    "operation": "create",
    "list": "9884a65adf",
    "email": "={{ $json.email }}",
    "status": "subscribed",
    "emailType": "html",
    "mergeFields": {
      "FNAME": "={{ $json.firstName }}",
      "LNAME": "={{ $json.lastName }}",
      "USERTYPE": "={{ $json.userType }}",
      "SPECIALTY": "={{ $json.specialty || '' }}",
      "PRACTICE": "={{ $json.practiceModel || '' }}",
      "EMR": "={{ $json.emrSystem || '' }}",
      "CHALLENGE": "={{ $json.challenge || '' }}",
      "COFOUNDER": "={{ $json.cofounder ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}",
      "LINKEDIN": "={{ $json.linkedin || '' }}"
    },
    "tags": [
      "={{ $json.userType }}",
      "={{ $json.cofounder ? 'cofounder-interest' : 'standard' }}",
      "={{ $json.userType === 'physician' && $json.practiceModel === 'independent' ? 'high-priority' : '' }}"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Create Mailchimp Automations

Log into Mailchimp and create 3 separate automations:

### Automation 1: Physician Welcome Email

**Trigger**: Tag added = "physician"

**Email Content**:
```

## Step 3: Create High-Priority Automation

**Trigger**: Tag added = "cofounder-interest"

**Email Content**: Immediate personal follow-up from you within 24 hours

## Step 4: Update n8n Workflow

Your workflow should now:
1. Trigger from form submission
2. Log to Google Sheets
3. Add to Mailchimp with tags and merge fields (ALL users, not just physicians)
4. Notify Telegram for high-priority leads

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No additional OAuth setup** - Uses existing Mailchimp connection
✅ **Scalable** - Mailchimp handles delivery, tracking, and analytics
✅ **Professional** - Better deliverability than Gmail
✅ **Automated** - Set once and forget
✅ **Segmented** - Different journeys based on user type
✅ **Trackable** - See open rates, click rates, conversions

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update n8n node to add ALL users to Mailchimp (not just physicians)
- [ ] Include merge fields for personalization
- [ ] Add appropriate tags for segmentation
- [ ] Create 3 automations in Mailchimp (physician, investor, specialist)
- [ ] Create co-founder priority automation
