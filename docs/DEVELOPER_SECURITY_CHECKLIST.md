## üèÅ Onboarding Security Checklist

### New Developer Setup
- [ ] Complete security training
- [ ] Install required security tools (see Tools section)
- [ ] Configure IDE with security plugins
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Review and acknowledge security policies
- [ ] Get access to security communication channels
- [ ] Receive security contact information

### Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Install and configure git secrets scanner
- [ ] Set up environment variables correctly

## üìù Daily Development Checklist

### Before Starting Work
- [ ] Pull latest changes from main branch
- [ ] Check for security advisories in dependencies

## üîç Pre-Commit Security Scan

### Quick Command Check
```bash
# Run this before EVERY commit
npm run security:pre-commit

# Manual checks if automated tools fail
git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|key\|token" || echo "‚úÖ No obvious secrets found"
git status --porcelain | grep -E "\.(env|key|pem|p12)$" || echo "‚úÖ No credential files staged"
```

### What to Look For
- [ ] API keys (sk-*, pk-*, key-, token-)
- [ ] Passwords or secrets
- [ ] Database connection strings
- [ ] Private keys (.pem, .key files)
- [ ] Environment files (.env, .env.local)
- [ ] Configuration with sensitive data

## üõ°Ô∏è Code Security Checklist

- [ ] XSS prevention (output encoding)
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Proper password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2)
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] JWT tokens properly validated
- [ ] Role-based access control implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Secure communication (HTTPS/TLS)
- [ ] Personal data handling complies with privacy laws
- [ ] Proper data retention policies followed
- [ ] Secure backup and recovery procedures

### Error Handling
- [ ] No sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] Proper logging without sensitive data
- [ ] Graceful failure handling
- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] Error responses don't reveal system information

## üîß Required Security Tools

### IDE/Editor Plugins
```bash
# VS Code Security Extensions
code --install-extension ms-vscode.vscode-json
code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension ms-vscode.security-extension

# Vim/Neovim plugins
# Add security-focused plugins to your config
```

### Command Line Tools
```bash
# Install required security tools
npm install -g @gitguardian/ggshield
npm install --save-dev detect-secrets
pip install bandit safety
brew install git-secrets trufflesecurity/trufflehog/trufflehog

# Configure git secrets
git secrets --register-aws
git secrets --install
```

### Pre-commit Configuration
Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-added-large-files
      - id: check-merge-conflict
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: detect-private-key
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace

  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']

  - repo: https://github.com/gitguardian/ggshield
    rev: v1.25.0
    hooks:
      - id: ggshield
        language: python
        stages: [commit]
```

## üö® Red Flags - Stop Immediately

### Code Red Situations
If you see any of these, **STOP** and alert the security team:
- [ ] Hardcoded API keys or passwords in code
- [ ] Sensitive data being logged
- [ ] Database credentials in configuration files
- [ ] Private keys committed to repository
- [ ] Environment files (.env) in version control
- [ ] Suspicious network requests or connections

### Immediate Actions
1. **Don't commit** the problematic code
2. **Remove** sensitive data immediately
3. **Alert** security team via Slack #security-alerts
4. **Document** what happened for investigation
5. **Review** recent commits for similar issues

## üìã Code Review Security Checklist

### As a Reviewer
- [ ] Check for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Verify input validation is present
- [ ] Ensure error handling doesn't leak info
- [ ] Confirm authentication/authorization logic
- [ ] Review dependency updates for security
- [ ] Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify proper logging practices

### Security-Focused Questions
- "Could this input be manipulated maliciously?"
- "Are we properly validating user permissions?"
- "Could this error message reveal sensitive information?"
- "Are we following the principle of least privilege?"
- "Is this data properly encrypted/protected?"

## üåê Web Security Checklist

### Frontend Security
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (HSTS headers)
- [ ] Secure cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- [ ] XSS protection enabled
- [ ] CSRF tokens implemented
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code

### API Security
- [ ] Proper authentication on all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] API versioning implemented

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Security Checklist

### Database Operations
- [ ] Use parameterized queries (no string concatenation)
- [ ] Principle of least privilege for database users
- [ ] Regular database updates and patches
- [ ] Proper backup encryption
- [ ] Database connection encryption (TLS)
- [ ] SQL injection testing completed

### Example: Secure Database Query
```javascript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Parameterized query
const user = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1 AND active = $2',
  [userId, true]
);

// ‚ùå WRONG - String concatenation (SQL injection risk)
const user = await db.query(
  `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId} AND active = true`
);
```
