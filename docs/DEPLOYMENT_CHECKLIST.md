## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
# Quick Deployment
npm run deploy:prod              # Deploy to production
npm run deploy                   # Deploy to preview

# Monitoring & Health Checks  
npm run monitor                  # Start real-time monitoring
npm run health:check            # Quick health verification
./scripts/deployment-status.sh  # Comprehensive status report

# Cache Management
npm run cache:invalidate         # Force cache refresh
./scripts/cache-invalidate.sh   # Manual cache invalidation

# Performance Analysis
npm run performance:check        # Run Lighthouse audit
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### If Deployment Shows 401/404 Errors:
1. **Check Build Status**: `npx vercel ls` to see deployment status
2. **Wait for Build**: New deployments may take 2-3 minutes to complete
3. **Check Logs**: Use Vercel dashboard for detailed build logs
4. **Redeploy**: Run `./scripts/deploy.sh production` for fresh deployment

### If Changes Not Reflected:
1. **Clear Cache**: Run `./scripts/cache-invalidate.sh`
2. **Force Refresh**: Use incognito/private browsing
3. **Check Build**: Ensure local build works with `npm run build`
4. **Verify Git**: Ensure changes are committed and pushed
