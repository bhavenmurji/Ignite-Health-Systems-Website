## Hero Section

### Before vs After: The Independence Crisis

Independent practice ownership dropped from 60.1% to 42.2% in just 12 years. Physicians spend 49.2% of office time on EHR work plus 1-2 hours nightly. We're giving you back 10+ minutes per encounter—time to heal, not click.

**Key Statistics:**
- **42.2%** of physicians in private practice (down from 60.1% in 2012)
- **49.2%** of office time spent on EHR/desk work
- **1-2 hours** of after-hours EHR work nightly

---

## Proof Band

**60.1% → 42.2%**: Independent practice ownership declined 18 percentage points (2012-2024)

**Administrative burden is driving practice consolidation.** Ignite is doctor-first infrastructure built to counter these forces and preserve physician independence.

## The Evolution of a Doctor's Workflow: From Chaos to Ignite

*If learning, practice, and testing don't talk to each other, clinicians pay in clicks—and patients pay in outcomes*

### Before AI: The Fragmented Healthcare Maze

**Learning happened here:**
- Medical journals and research papers
- UpToDate.com and OpenEvidence
- Isolated from actual practice

**Practice happened here:**
- EMR with zero clinical decision support
- Endless clicking between tabs
- Documentation stealing time from patients

**Testing happened here:**
- AAFP and ABFM question banks
- AMBOSS and UWorld for board prep
- Completely disconnected from real cases

**The result:** Three separate worlds that never talked to each other. Constant context-switching, lost cognitive focus, and missed connections.

### The Ignite Future: One Unified Intelligence

**5:30 AM - Intelligent Precharting:**
- AI analyzes schedule and patient histories
- One conversation per patient where AI sees everything
- Clinical decision support flows naturally
- Zero clicking between platforms

**7:00 AM - Supercharged Patient Care:**
- Walk in with complete context synthesized
- Real-time evidence and guidelines appear contextually
- Documentation happens invisibly
- Focus stays on the patient

**6:00 PM - Personalized Learning:**
- AI analyzes daily clinical decisions
- Generates targeted questions from real cases
- Continuous feedback loop: Learn → Practice → Improve

**The transformation:** One unified intelligence layer that makes you a supercharged human doctor.
