# üö® URGENT: Manual Cloudflare Configuration Required

## ‚úÖ What's Working:
- GitHub Pages deployment is LIVE at: https://bhavenmurji.github.io/Ignite-Health-Systems-Website/
- GitHub Actions workflow is successfully deploying your site
- CNAME file is correctly set to `ignitehealthsystems.com`

## ‚ùå What's Not Working:
- Cloudflare is trying to connect to the wrong origin server
- This causes the 522 timeout error

## üîß IMMEDIATE MANUAL FIX REQUIRED:

### Option 1: Configure Cloudflare to Point to GitHub Pages (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Login to Cloudflare Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
   - Select your domain: ignitehealthsystems.com

2. **Update DNS Records**
   - Delete ALL existing A and AAAA records
   - Add these records:

   | Type | Name | Content | Proxy Status |
   |------|------|---------|--------------|
   | CNAME | @ | bhavenmurji.github.io | Proxied (orange cloud) |
   | CNAME | www | bhavenmurji.github.io | Proxied (orange cloud) |

3. **Configure SSL/TLS Settings**
   - Go to SSL/TLS ‚Üí Overview
   - Set encryption mode to: **Full**

4. **Configure Page Rules** (Optional but recommended)
   - Go to Rules ‚Üí Page Rules
   - Create rule: `http://ignitehealthsystems.com/*`
   - Setting: Always Use HTTPS

### Option 2: Bypass Cloudflare Temporarily

If you need the site working IMMEDIATELY:

1. **Update DNS at your domain registrar**
   - Point directly to GitHub Pages:
   - A record: 185.199.108.153
   - A record: 185.199.109.153
   - A record: 185.199.110.153
   - A record: 185.199.111.153

2. **Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation**

## üìä Current Status:

- **GitHub Pages URL**: ‚úÖ https://bhavenmurji.github.io/Ignite-Health-Systems-Website/ (WORKING!)
- **Custom Domain**: ‚ùå https://ignitehealthsystems.com (522 Error - Needs Cloudflare fix)

## üéØ After Cloudflare Configuration:

Your site will be accessible at:
- https://ignitehealthsystems.com ‚úÖ
- https://www.ignitehealthsystems.com ‚úÖ

With benefits:
- Cloudflare CDN and caching
- DDoS protection
- SSL certificate
- Performance optimization

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline:
- **Cloudflare changes**: Take effect in 1-5 minutes
- **Full propagation**: May take up to 30 minutes

## üÜò If You Need Help:
1. Share your Cloudflare login (temporarily) for me to configure
2. Or follow the steps above in Cloudflare dashboard
3. The site IS deployed and working - we just need to connect Cloudflare to it!

**Your website is DEPLOYED and WORKING! We just need to point Cloudflare to it.**
