## Executive Summary

Microsoft's multimodal generative AI approach integrates diverse patient data streams (clinical notes, imaging, genomics) into unified embeddings that serve as digital twins. This enables population-scale analysis of treatment outcomes, with particular success in oncology. Key innovations include dilated attention transformers for whole-slide image processing and cross-modal alignment using text as interlingua. Clinical implementations at Providence Health System demonstrate 40% increases in precision therapy adoption and improved trial matching. While showing promise, challenges remain in longitudinal modeling and ethical deployment.
