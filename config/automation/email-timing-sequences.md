## 🎯 Physician Welcome Email Sequence

### **Primary Sequence Timeline**
```
Form Submission → Immediate (0 min)
├── Physician Welcome Email
│   ├── Personalized greeting with specialty focus
│   ├── Challenge acknowledgment
│   └── Demo scheduling CTA
│
3 Days Later (if email opened)
├── Demo Follow-up Email
│   ├── Specialty-specific use cases
│   ├── ROI calculator
│   └── Calendar booking reminder
│
7 Days Later (if no demo scheduled)
├── Success Stories Email
│   ├── Similar specialty testimonials
│   ├── Implementation case studies

│
14 Days Later (final touchpoint)
└── Final Invitation Email
    ├── Exclusive Clinical Innovation Council invite
    ├── Founder personal note
    └── Last chance for early access
```

### **Timing Rationale**
- **Immediate**: Strike while interest is hot, confirm subscription
- **3 Days**: Allow time to process initial information, optimal re-engagement window
- **7 Days**: Overcome initial hesitation with social proof
- **14 Days**: Final opportunity before moving to nurture sequence

### **Conditional Logic**
- If **Clinical Innovation Council = YES**: Add CV review acknowledgment in initial email
- If **Practice Model = DPC**: Emphasize cash-pay optimization features
- If **Specialty = Specialist**: Redirect to specialist-specific sequence after Day 3

## 📊 Engagement-Based Timing Optimization

### **Email Open Behavior**
```
High Engagement (Opens within 2 hours)
├── Accelerate sequence by 50%
├── Add premium content
└── Priority demo scheduling

Medium Engagement (Opens within 24 hours)
├── Standard timing maintained
├── A/B test subject lines
└── Engagement tracking focus

Low Engagement (Opens after 48+ hours)
├── Extend intervals by 25%
├── Simplify messaging
└── Re-engagement campaign trigger
```

### **Click-Through Behavior**

- **Single Click**: Continue standard sequence with engagement tracking
- **No Clicks**: Simplify CTAs and reduce cognitive load

## 🔄 Cross-Sequence Optimization

### **Sequence Switching Logic**
```
Physician Sequence → Specialist Sequence
├── Trigger: Specialty keywords detected in responses
├── Timing: Immediately after current email
└── Personalization: Maintain conversation continuity

Any Sequence → Investor Sequence
├── Trigger: Investment interest indicators
├── Timing: Immediate priority escalation
└── Dual-track: Continue original + add investor track

Standard → Co-founder Alert
├── Trigger: Council interest + high engagement
├── Timing: Immediate internal notification
└── Sequence Override: Priority alert takes precedence
```

### **Re-engagement Triggers**
- **Email bounced**: Update contact info request
- **Unsubscribed**: Exit sequence gracefully with feedback request
- **High engagement return**: Re-enter at appropriate sequence point
- **Referral source**: Custom sequence based on referrer type
