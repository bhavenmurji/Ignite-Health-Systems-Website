# Telegram Approval Detection System Architecture

## System Overview

The Telegram Approval Detection System is designed to create a secure, efficient approval workflow for content distribution within the n8n automation pipeline. This system enables authorized personnel to approve newsletter content, article distribution, and other marketing materials via Telegram messages.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Telegram as Primary Approval Channel
**Decision**: Use Telegram as the primary approval mechanism for content distribution.

**Rationale**:
- Real-time notifications ensure immediate awareness
- Mobile-first approach enables approval from anywhere
- Rich message formatting supports context-aware decisions
- Secure bot API with webhook capabilities
- Integration with existing workflow notifications

**Trade-offs**:
- Dependency on Telegram platform availability
- Requires proper bot security configuration
- Need for fallback mechanisms if Telegram is unavailable

### ADR-002: Keyword-Based Approval Recognition
**Decision**: Implement fuzzy keyword matching for approval detection.

**Rationale**:
- Natural language interaction reduces friction
- Multiple approval variations accommodate different communication styles
- Context-aware matching prevents false positives
- Extensible pattern system for future requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- Risk of false positives with ambiguous messages
- Need for comprehensive keyword pattern database
- Complexity in handling multilingual approval terms

### ADR-003: Multi-Level Authorization System
**Decision**: Implement role-based authorization with multiple approval levels.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures proper governance for different content types
- Supports escalation workflows for high-impact content
- Maintains audit trail for compliance requirements
- Flexible role assignment based on organizational structure

**Trade-offs**:
- Increased complexity in permission management
- Potential for approval bottlenecks with multiple required approvers
- Need for clear role definition and communication

## Quality Attributes

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Telegram user ID verification against authorized approver database
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with content type permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all approval actions with timestamps
- **Non-repudiation**: Cryptographic verification of approval authenticity

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for approval detection and processing
- **Throughput**: Support for 100+ approval requests per hour
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for increased approval volume

### Reliability Requirements
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed webhook deliveries
- **Data Consistency**: ACID compliance for approval state management
- **Recovery**: Complete system state restoration within 5 minutes
- **Backup**: Real-time approval data replication

## Integration Points

### External Systems
1. **Google Sheets**: User authorization database and approval logging
2. **Mailchimp**: Email campaign distribution system
3. **Telegram Bot API**: Message handling and notifications
4. **n8n Workflow Engine**: Process orchestration and automation

### Internal Components
1. **Content Management**: Article and newsletter content storage
2. **User Management**: Authorized approver database with roles
3. **Audit System**: Complete approval action logging
4. **Notification System**: Multi-channel approval confirmations

## Deployment Architecture

- False positive/negative rates for keyword detection
- User authorization success rates
- System availability and error rates

### Alerting Strategy
- Critical: System downtime, authorization failures
- Warning: High response times, approval backlogs
- Info: Daily approval summaries, usage analytics

## Future Extensibility

### Planned Enhancements
