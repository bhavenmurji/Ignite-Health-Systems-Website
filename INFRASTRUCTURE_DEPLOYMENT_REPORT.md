## ⚠️ Issues Encountered

### Cloudflare API Limitations
The Cloudflare Pages API encountered several issues:

1. **Project Not Found (404)**: API couldn't access the existing project
2. **Method Not Allowed (405)**: Environment variable API endpoints restricted
3. **Permission Issues**: Current API token may need updated permissions

**Solution**: Manual Cloudflare Pages setup required through dashboard

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### 1. Cloudflare Pages Setup (Required)
1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → Pages
2. Create/update the project: `ignite-health-systems-website`
3. Connect to GitHub repository: `bhavenmurji/Ignite-Health-Systems-Website`
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Output directory: `out`
   - Node.js version: `18`

### 2. Environment Variables (Cloudflare Dashboard)
Add these in Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://bhavenmurji.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/ignite-interest-form
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://ignitehealthsystems.com
NEXTJS_VERSION=14.2.33
```

### 3. GitHub Secrets Setup
Run the automated setup:
```bash
./scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh
```

Or manually add these secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
