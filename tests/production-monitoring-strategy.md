# Production Monitoring Strategy for Mailchimp Automation Workflow

## 🎯 Monitoring Overview

This monitoring strategy provides comprehensive observability for the Ignite Health Systems interest form automation workflow in production, ensuring high availability, performance, and immediate issue detection.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary Business Metrics
- **Lead Conversion Rate**: Form submissions → successful processing
- **Email Delivery Rate**: Successfully delivered welcome emails
- **Response Time**: Form submission → first email delivery
- **Co-founder Alert Speed**: Special leads → Telegram notification time
- **Data Quality**: Accuracy of lead information across systems

### Technical Health Metrics
- **Workflow Success Rate**: n8n execution completion percentage
- **API Response Times**: Individual service response metrics
- **Error Rate**: Failed executions per time period
- **Queue Depth**: Pending workflow executions
- **Resource Usage**: n8n instance performance metrics

## 🔍 Monitoring Components

### 1. n8n Workflow Monitoring

#### Built-in n8n Metrics
```javascript
// Webhook endpoint monitoring
GET /webhook/ignite-interest-form/stats
- Total executions: count
- Success rate: percentage
- Average execution time: milliseconds
- Last execution: timestamp
- Error count: number
```

#### Custom Monitoring Webhook
Add monitoring node to workflow:
```json
{
  "name": "Log Execution Metrics",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook",
  "parameters": {
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "path": "workflow-metrics",
    "responseMode": "onReceived",
    "options": {
      "rawBody": true
    }
  },
  "webhookId": "execution-logger"
}
```

#### Execution Logging
```javascript
const executionMetrics = {
  workflowId: "interest-form-handler",
  executionId: "{{ $workflow.id }}",
  timestamp: "{{ $now.toISO() }}",
  userType: "{{ $json.userType }}",
  cofounderInterest: "{{ $json.cofounder }}",
  executionTime: "{{ $workflow.executionTime }}",
  status: "success|failed",
  errorMessage: "{{ $error.message || null }}",
  nodesFailed: "{{ $workflow.failedNodes || [] }}"
}
```

### 2. API Service Monitoring

#### Google Sheets API Health
```bash
# Check Google Sheets API accessibility
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOGLE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/1kPYgthwKzREJYKjAnE4h1YFMRxg5ulynrbDYNRxb8Lo" \
  -w "Response Time: %{time_total}s\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
```

#### Mailchimp API Health
```bash
# Monitor Mailchimp API status
curl -X GET "https://us18.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/ping" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'anystring:$MAILCHIMP_API_KEY' | base64)" \
  -w "Response Time: %{time_total}s\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
```

#### Gmail API Health
```bash
# Check Gmail API quota and health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  "https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/profile" \
  -w "Response Time: %{time_total}s\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
```

#### Telegram Bot Health
```bash
# Verify Telegram bot responsiveness
curl -X GET "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/getMe" \
  -w "Response Time: %{time_total}s\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
```

### 3. Data Quality Monitoring

#### Lead Data Validation Script
```javascript
// Monitor data integrity across systems
const validateLeadData = async () => {
  const recentLeads = await getGoogleSheetsData();
  const mailchimpContacts = await getMailchimpContacts();

  const metrics = {
    totalLeads: recentLeads.length,
    mailchimpSynced: 0,
    dataDiscrepancies: [],
    duplicateEmails: [],
    missingFields: []
  };

  recentLeads.forEach(lead => {
    const mailchimpContact = mailchimpContacts.find(c => c.email === lead.email);

    if (mailchimpContact) {
      metrics.mailchimpSynced++;

      // Check data consistency
      if (lead.userType !== mailchimpContact.merge_fields.USERTYPE) {
        metrics.dataDiscrepancies.push({
          email: lead.email,
          field: 'userType',
          sheets: lead.userType,
          mailchimp: mailchimpContact.merge_fields.USERTYPE
        });
      }
    }

    // Check for missing critical fields
    if (!lead.firstName || !lead.email || !lead.userType) {
      metrics.missingFields.push({
        email: lead.email,
        missing: []
      });
    }
  });

  return metrics;
};
```
