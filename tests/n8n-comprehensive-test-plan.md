- **WARN**: Rate limits approached, minor failures, retries
- **ERROR**: API failures, authentication issues, workflow failures
- **SECURITY**: Unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activity

### Alerting Rules
- **Critical**: Workflow failure, authentication errors
- **Warning**: High error rate (>5%), slow performance (>2x normal)
- **Info**: Successful completion, milestone achievements
