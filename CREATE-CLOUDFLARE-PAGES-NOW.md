# üö® URGENT: Create Cloudflare Pages Project

## The Problem
Your DNS is correct, but there's NO Cloudflare Pages project deployed. That's why you get Error 522.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Create the Pages Project (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click **"Workers & Pages"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create application"** button
4. Click **"Pages"** tab
5. Click **"Connect to Git"**

### Step 2: Connect GitHub
1. Click **"Connect GitHub"**
2. Authorize Cloudflare to access your GitHub
3. Search for and select: **"Ignite-Health-Systems-Website"**
4. Click **"Begin setup"**

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
**EXACT SETTINGS TO USE:**
```
Project name: ignite-health-systems-website
Production branch: main
Framework preset: Next.js
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: out
Root directory: /
Node.js version: 18
```

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Click **"Environment variables"** and add:
```
Variable name: NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL
Value: https://bhavenmurji.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/ignite-interest-form
```

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Save and Deploy"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build

## üéØ After Deployment Completes

Your site will be live at:
- https://ignite-health-systems-website.pages.dev (test this first)
- https://ignitehealthsystems.com (will work after Pages deploys)
- https://www.ignitehealthsystems.com (will work after Pages deploys)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline
- Build time: 2-3 minutes
- DNS propagation: Already done
- **Total time to live site: 5 minutes**

## üîç How to Verify It's Working

1. First check: https://ignite-health-systems-website.pages.dev
   - Should show your website
   - No Error 522

2. Then check: https://ignitehealthsystems.com
   - Should show the same website
   - Green lock icon (SSL)

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

- DON'T change framework preset from Next.js
- DON'T use `.next` as output directory (use `out`)
- DON'T forget the environment variable
- DON'T select the wrong GitHub repo

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you still see Error 522 after deployment:
1. Check the build logs in Cloudflare Pages
2. Make sure the build succeeded
3. Verify the output directory is `out`
4. Check that Node.js version is 18

The most common issue is selecting the wrong build output directory. It MUST be `out` for Next.js static export.
