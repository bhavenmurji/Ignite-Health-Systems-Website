## On-Page SEO Optimization

### Title Tag Optimization

**Current State**: Generic titles lacking keyword focus
**Recommended Format**: `Primary Keyword | Benefit Statement | Brand Name`

**Examples**:
```html
<!-- Homepage -->
<title>Healthcare Workflow Automation Software | 60% Time Reduction | Ignite Health Systems</title>

<!-- Platform Page -->
<title>Medical Practice Management Platform | ROI Calculator Included | Ignite Health</title>

<!-- Problem Page -->
<title>Healthcare Workflow Problems | Administrative Burden Solutions | Ignite Health</title>

<!-- About Page -->
<title>Healthcare Automation Experts | 200+ Practice Transformations | Ignite Health</title>
```

### Meta Description Optimization

**Best Practices**:
- 150-160 characters maximum
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Compelling benefit statement
- Clear call-to-action
- Avoid keyword stuffing

**Examples**:
```html
<meta name="description" content="Reduce healthcare administrative time by 60% with proven workflow automation. Join 200+ practices saving $150K+ annually. Free ROI calculator included.">

<meta name="description" content="Transform your medical practice with automation software that streamlines workflows and improves patient satisfaction. See ROI in 30 days.">

<meta name="description" content="Healthcare workflow automation case studies: See how practices reduced wait times 68% and increased revenue 35%. Download free implementation guide.">
```

### Header Structure Optimization

**H1 Tags** (One per page, include primary keyword):
```html
<h1>Healthcare Workflow Automation: Transform Your Practice Operations</h1>
<h1>Medical Practice Management Software That Delivers ROI</h1>
<h1>Reduce Patient Wait Times by 60% with Smart Automation</h1>
```

**H2 Tags** (Include secondary keywords and variations):
```html

<h2>Medical Practice Efficiency Tools Comparison</h2>
```

**H3 Tags** (Support content structure with related terms):
```html

<h3>Revenue Cycle Management Automation</h3>
```

### Internal Linking Strategy

**Hub and Spoke Model**:
- Pillar pages link to all cluster content
- Cluster content links back to pillar page
- Cross-cluster linking for related topics
- Deep linking to specific page sections

**Anchor Text Optimization**:
```html
<!-- Exact match (use sparingly) -->
<a href="/healthcare-workflow-automation">healthcare workflow automation</a>

<!-- Partial match (preferred) -->
<a href="/workflow-automation-roi">calculate your automation ROI</a>

<!-- Branded/natural (for diversity) -->
<a href="/case-studies">see how Regional Medical Group saved $420K</a>
```

**Internal Link Distribution**:
- 5-8 internal links per 1,000 words of content
- Link to both pillar pages and supporting content
- Include links to conversion pages (demo, ROI calculator)
- Link to recent, relevant content

### Site Speed Optimization

**Additional Optimizations**:

  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Healthcare workflow automation dashboard" loading="lazy">
</picture>
```

#### CSS Optimization

/* Critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content */
<style>
  /* Inline critical styles for hero section, navigation */
  .hero-section { /* critical styles */ }
  .nav-menu { /* critical styles */ }
</style>

<!-- Lazy load non-critical CSS -->
<link rel="preload" href="non-critical.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
```

#### JavaScript Optimization
```javascript
// Leverage existing script loader for SEO-critical functions
if (window.IgniteScriptLoader) {
  // Prioritize SEO-related scripts
  window.IgniteScriptLoader.addScript({
    src: 'js/seo-optimization.js',
    async: true,
    defer: false
  }, 'high');
}
```

### URL Structure Optimization
