## üîç Specific Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Content (Critical)**
- **Desktop:** ~3,000 pixels of missing height (47% of content)
- **Mobile:** ~7,000 pixels of missing height (62% of content)
- **Implication:** Entire sections of the website are missing

### 2. **Layout Structure (Critical)**
- Completely different page organization
- Missing components and sections
- Different content hierarchy
- Altered navigation structure

### 3. **Visual Design (Critical)**
- Different color schemes throughout
- Typography mismatches (fonts, sizes, weights)
- Spacing and padding inconsistencies
- Missing visual elements (images, icons, graphics)

### 4. **Responsive Behavior (Critical)**
- Mobile layout differs drastically from original
- Breakpoint behaviors don't match
- Content organization changes significantly

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)
1. **Stop Current Development**
   - Halt any further development on current Next.js implementation
   - Conduct full requirements analysis comparing original vs current

2. **Content Audit**
   - Document all sections present in original HTML
   - Identify missing components in Next.js version
   - Create gap analysis report

3. **Rebuild Strategy**
   - Start component-by-component rebuilding process
   - Use original HTML as pixel-perfect reference
   - Implement section-by-section with visual validation

### Implementation Process
1. **Design System Extraction**
   - Extract exact color palette from original
   - Document typography specifications
   - Catalog spacing and layout measurements
   - Identify all visual elements and assets

2. **Component Development**
   - Build each section to match original exactly
   - Test responsive behavior on all breakpoints
   - Validate with visual comparison after each component

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run pixel comparison tests after each section
   - Target <5% visual difference before moving to next section
   - Cross-browser and cross-device testing
