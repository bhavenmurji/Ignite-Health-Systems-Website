## Before AI: The Fragmented Healthcare Maze

**My learning happened here:**

- Medical journals and research papers
- UpToDate.com and OpenEvidence for clinical decisions
- Isolated from my actual practice

**My practice happened here:**

- EMR system with zero clinical decision support
- Endless clicking between tabs and screens
- Documentation burden stealing time from patients

**My testing happened here:**

- AAFP and ABFM question banks on separate platforms
- AMBOSS and UWorld for board prep
- Anki and Ora AI for flashcards
- Completely disconnected from my real cases

**The result:** Three separate worlds that never talked to each other. I was constantly context-switching between platforms, losing cognitive focus, and missing the connections between what I learned, practiced, and was tested on.

## Current AI: Still Fragmented, Just Faster

**My current workflow with today’s AI:**

**5:30 AM - Precharting with DAX:**

- Wake up an hour before work
- Click through patient charts, tabs open everywhere
- Read everything out loud into DAX Copilot for each patient
- DAX can’t see the chart data, so I’m essentially narrating blindly
- Look up evidence on separate platforms when needed

**7:00 AM - Patient Care:**

- Run through patient list with my MA
- See patients while trying to avoid logging into computers
- Have conversations with DAX recording (second recording per patient)
- Step out to pseudo-dictate what DAX couldn’t capture from the chart
- Sometimes show patients their data by logging in during the visit
- Read lab results out loud so DAX can include them in notes
- Wait for DAX to generate SOAP notes and billing codes

**6:00 PM - Evening Study:**

- Go home and study questions related to my daily cases
- Create flashcards from incorrect answers
- Use completely separate platforms from my clinical work

**The problems persist:**

- DAX provides no clinical decision support (unlike OpenEvidence)
- OpenEvidence doesn’t auto-populate my EMR (manual copy/paste)
- Neither system accesses stored chart data
- No connection between my clinical performance and my learning
- Still endless clicking between fragmented systems

## The Ignite Future: One Unified Intelligence

**Imagine this workflow instead:**

**5:30 AM - Intelligent Precharting:**

- AI has already analyzed my schedule and patient histories
- One conversation per patient where AI sees everything - chart data, latest evidence, guidelines
- Clinical decision support flows naturally as I review cases
- Zero clicking between platforms

**7:00 AM - Supercharged Patient Care:**

- Walk into rooms with complete context already synthesized
- AI captures ambient conversation while accessing full chart history
- Real-time evidence and clinical guidelines appear contextually
- Drug interactions, allergies, contraindications automatically flagged
- Documentation happens invisibly while I focus on the patient

**6:00 PM - Personalized Learning:**

- AI analyzes my daily clinical decisions against evidence-based guidelines
- Generates targeted questions and flashcards based on my actual cases
- Creates learning vignettes from my real practice patterns
- Continuous feedback loop: Learn → Practice → Improve

**The transformation:**

- No more cognitive fragmentation across 7+ platforms
- No more context-switching that breaks clinical thinking
- No more documentation that steals time from patient care
- No more disconnected learning from isolated question banks

Instead: **One unified intelligence layer that makes me a supercharged human doctor.**

## The Vision: Stop Clicking, Start Healing

This isn’t about replacing doctors - it’s about freeing us from the digital busy-work that prevents great medicine.

When Simon Squibb asks “what’s your dream,” I say:

**“My dream is Ignite - AI that eliminates the endless clicking between screens so I can be a supercharged human doctor. Instead of fragmenting my attention across multiple platforms, I get one unified intelligence layer that makes me brilliant at the bedside, not just busy at the computer.”**

Because great doctors shouldn’t have to choose between excellent patient care and administrative survival.

**Ignite makes both effortless.**
### The 4 U’s Framework for Ignite
	
- **Unworkable:** Current EHRs are absolutely terrible. Current tools steal meaning and focus. Over 67% of EMR time vanishes into navigation instead of clinical reasoning, and 71% of clicks exist just for admin or billing—doctors are busy, not effective.[2][1]
- **Unavoidable:** Every physician deals with this nightmare: The pain is everywhere—private practices are dying, burnout is now at crisis levels, and doctors are fleeing medicine. If this isn’t fixed, patient care and trust will collapse entirely.[3][4][1]
- **Urgent:** Doctors are leaving private practice at alarming rates: The numbers are dire—only 42.2% of doctors remain in independent practice, down drastically. The never-ending admin tasks cost 70 hours a month per physician. That kills careers and patient trust alike.[4][1]
- **Underserved:**  Nobody’s solving this from a physician’s perspective: AI promises haven’t delivered yet. Even DAX and similar tools leave doctors narrating blindly, juggling platforms, and missing the magic of what unified technology could provide—no one has solved true workflow fusion or connected clinical performance with continuous learning.[5][1][2]

### Ignite: The Step-By-Step Staircase

1. **Start with “Zero-Lag, Voice-Enabled” Integration:** Eliminate clicks, unite patient data, evidence, and guidelines. Make AI support invisible and ever-present—ignite the joy of clinical reasoning.[6][7][1]
2. **Prove the Model with Direct Primary Care:** Launch the first real pilots in independent clinics desperate for relief. Measure time saved, burnout scores, and performance. Don’t theorize—show visible wins fast.[1][2]
3. **Link Learning and Practice Seamlessly:** Use AI to turn daily cases into personalized learning—test, teach, and guide each doctor in real time, closing the loop between study and bedside brilliance.[1]
4. **Scale with a Community-Led Movement:** Rally physician-entrepreneurs, not administrators. Build viral advocacy—doctors who love Ignite will spread it, because it rescues their lives and clinics.[8][1]

### Breaking Limiting Beliefs

- **Fear = Fuel**: This will challenge every old vendor and insurance company, but that’s power—keep it doctor-led and mission-driven.[9][1]
- **Constraints = Leverage**: Scrappy startup? Use it to move faster and listen better than giant incumbents. The chaos of US healthcare is not a curse—it’s a launchpad.
- **Purpose > Profit**: Every design and business decision has to ask, “Does this make doctors better at medicine?” Money will chase that level of service.[10][9][1]
- **Action, Not Planning**: Don’t wait for “perfect.” Ship Ignite into the hands of five practices this month. Every sprint reveals new value.[5][1]
- **Give Without Take**: Share knowledge, let early users guide features, and don’t nickel-and-dime for “premium” support. The community is the moat.[1]
