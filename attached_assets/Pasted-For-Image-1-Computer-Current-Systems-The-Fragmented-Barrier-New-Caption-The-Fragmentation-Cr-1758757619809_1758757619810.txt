For Image 1: Computer (Current Systems) - The Fragmented Barrier

New Caption: "The Fragmentation Crisis: Lost in the Digital Maze"
Current healthcare AI adds speed to broken workflows, forcing physicians to frantically click between fragmented systems. This isn't just inefficient; it's a barrier that steals precious time from patients and critical thinking from doctors. We're trapped in a digital maze, where essential insights are scattered across platforms, preventing seamless care and burning out dedicated professionals.

For Image 2: Ignite: Clinical Co-Pilot (Future System) - The Unified Intelligence

New Caption: "Ignite Solution: One Unified Intelligence Layer"
Imagine a future where you walk into patient rooms with complete context already synthesized. Ignite: Clinical Co-Pilot eliminates cognitive fragmentation, seamlessly connecting all vital information—from EHR to evidence-based guidelines—into one intuitive layer. This isn't about replacing doctors; it's about freeing them from digital busy-work, making them supercharged human doctors who can truly focus on healing.

For Image 3: Co-pilot (Aviation Analogy) - Orchestration & Command

New Caption: "Aviation Inspiration: Orchestrated Command, Unburdened Care"
Just as an aviation co-pilot expertly manages complex systems and crew, allowing the captain to command the flight, healthcare needs unified intelligence. This analogy underscores our vision: to offload the administrative and informational burden from physicians, empowering them to deliver exceptional patient care with seamless support, clarity, and restored autonomy.

Rationale behind the captions:
1. Current Crisis (Image 1): Directly uses "Fragmentation Crisis" from your content and vividly describes the problems of context-switching, disconnected systems, and time theft, emphasizing the "barrier" visual.
2. Ignite Solution (Image 2): Uses "Ignite Solution" and "One Unified Intelligence Layer," highlighting the seamless context, zero clicking, and the "supercharged human doctor" concept.
3. Aviation Inspiration (Image 3): Focuses on the "orchestration" and "unburdened care" aspect, directly connecting to the aviation analogy and reinforcing the idea of freeing the physician.
