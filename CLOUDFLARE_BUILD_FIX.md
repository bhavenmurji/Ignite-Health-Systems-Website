# CLOUDFLARE BUILD CONFIGURATION FIX

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SETTING TO CHANGE

In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard, the build output directory is currently set to:
```
/out
```

It MUST be changed to:
```
out
```

(Remove the leading slash!)

## How to Fix:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Workers & Pages → ignite-health-systems-website → Settings
3. Scroll to "Build configuration"
4. Change "Build output directory" from `/out` to `out`
5. Click "Save"

## This Will Fix:
- ✅ GitHub automatic deployments will start working
- ✅ Every push to main will auto-deploy
- ✅ No manual uploads needed

## Current Settings (Correct):
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build` ✅
- Build output: `out` (NOT `/out`) ⚠️ NEEDS FIX
- Root directory: `/` ✅
- Production branch: `main` ✅

Once you make this one-character change (remove the `/`), Cloudflare will automatically rebuild and your site will be live!
